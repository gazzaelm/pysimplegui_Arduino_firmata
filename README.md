I am developing a Rasberry Pi program to act as a car button cluster to operate relays on an Arduino Mega.
I also have a reversing camera window that has a button that changes colour depending on distance from an object. This gets distance from an Arduino UNO.
Both use firmata and pyfirmata to pass pin settings or turn relays on or off.
The button update is slow, but I am having problems speeding it up...
Also using pySimpleGUI for windows etc.
